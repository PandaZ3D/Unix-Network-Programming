Synopsis: make a simple ftp client/server

Approach:

First wrote out plan for what funtions I would need to implement this ftp server.
Then I started to make a library to implement just this. I created a packet struct
to be sent over the network. This was used for commands. 

Problems:

I cannot sent files but my library had implemented functionality of packets
ackknolwdgements and other things related to that.

Application cannot transfer files.

Known bugs:

Some of my functions and connections oddlt enough don't work without certain print
statements, it is rather odd. And as of now my client has a set Port number, if
I use wildcard 0 then I get an error. But if I use the exact port number printed on my terminal
then it works magically.
